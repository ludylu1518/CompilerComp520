# Comp 520 Compiler Project

School project where I built a compiler that compiles a simplified Java language version. 
The project's instructions and the Java language used are in the Instructions folder. 

## Components
#### Syntatic Analysis
    ##### Scanner
          Read in the file and convert them into Tokens.
    ##### Parser
          Read the Tokens and check if they follow the rules of the language.
#### Contextual Analysis
#### Code Generator
