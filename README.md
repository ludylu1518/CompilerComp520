# Comp 520 Compiler Project

School project where I built a compiler that compiles a simplified Java language version. 
The project's instructions and the Java language used are in the Instructions folder. 

## Components
### Syntatic Analysis
- **Scanner**: Read the files and convert them into Tokens.
- **Parser**: Read the Tokens and check if they follow the rules of the language.
### Contextual Analysis
- **Identification**: Check whether variables are declared corrected.
- **Type Checking**: Check whether the typing matches between variables and methods.
### Code Generator
Convert the file into a set of instructions that the machine can understand (Assembly Language).
